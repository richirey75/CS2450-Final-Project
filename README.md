# CS4990 Data Scraping Project

## Project Overview

This project is part of our CS4990 class. While we are still clarifying the specific objectives of our analysis, we have decided to scrape data from Spotify as our primary source.

## Tools

- **Google Colab**: We will use Google Colab for collaborative coding and execution of our data scraping scripts.
- **Python**: Our data scraping and analysis will be implemented using Python, leveraging its powerful libraries for data handling.

## Current Progress

- **Data Source**: Spotify
- **Data Scraping**: We have identified our target platform and are in the process of setting up the data scraping functionality.

## Next Steps

1. **Define Analysis Goals**: We will soon determine what specific aspects of the Spotify data we want to analyze.
2. **Implement Data Scraping**: Continue developing the code to efficiently scrape the required data from Spotify.
3. **Data Analysis**: Once we have the data, we will conduct our analysis based on the defined goals.
